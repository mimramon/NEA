### Introduction
For my project I have decided to create a 3D RPG game using the Unity game engine and C# as the scripting language, this requires use of object oriented programming and this report will detail the process taken to achieve this including all the problems that arose during development.

### Analysis

#### The Problem
To me RPG games are some of the most enjoyable types of games, mostly due to their involvement with high fantasy plot lines and the intricacy and potential customization of the stat systems and characters. However a problem I encounter nowadays is that many RPGs are dumbing down their intricate magic and stat systems to appeal to a wider audience, whilst i think it is great that more people will be able to enjoy these fantastic experience, I dont think that stripping away the intricate potential of the game is the right way to go about it, therefore I decided to make an RPG game that would have complex and fleshed out customization systems. I believe that the apropriate target audience is people that are around my age as i think that one of the crucial gaming markets is in this age bracket, this is because an impactful experience at this age will likely retain them in this market through their adulthood too.

### So What Do Existing RPG Games Look Like?
