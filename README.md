## Introduction
For my project I have decided to create a 3D RPG game using the Unity game engine and C# as the scripting language, this requires use of object oriented programming and this report will detail the process taken to achieve this including all the problems that arose during development.

## Analysis

### The Problem
To me RPG games are some of the most enjoyable types of games, mostly due to their involvement with high fantasy plot lines and the intricacy and potential customisation of the stat systems and characters. However a problem I encounter nowadays is that many RPGs are dumbing down their intricate magic and stat systems to appeal to a wider audience, whilst i think it is great that more people will be able to enjoy these fantastic experience, I dont think that stripping away the intricate potential of the game is the right way to go about it, therefore I decided to make an RPG game that will have complex and fleshed out customisation systems. I believe that the appropriate target audience is people that are around my age as i think that one of the crucial gaming markets is in this age bracket, this is because an impactful experience at this age will likely retain them in this market through their adulthood too.

## So What Do Existing RPG Games Look Like?
To get an idea of what the RPG market looks like, I reviewed the following games:

### Skyrim
Cost: £30

Steam Rating: Very positive (94% of players reccomend)

Platforms: Windows, PS3, Xbox 360, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch

#### Review
Skyrim is an extremely popular open-world RPG game that is the latest installment in 'The Elder Scrolls' franchise. It has an interesting and engaging story that keeps the player constantly exploring the vast landscape of Skyrim. The game has a 3D 'Realistic' art style that allows for the player to become immersed in the game. Whilst Skyrim has many great qualities, such as a huge world, many entertaining quests, and varied enemies, it also has many shortcomings. In my opinion the biggest waste of potential is the magic system. Skyrim's magic system lacks any kind of complexity and is as linear as can be, the magic in Skyrim can be split into a few categories: Illusion, Alteration, Destruction, Conjuration, Restoration and Enchanting, with each of the schools having its own skill tree. Whilst at first this may seem like it allows for a lot of different combinations, most of the time half of an entire skill tree is completely useless and provides little to no benefit for the player, this is even worse when you realise that most of the perks on the skill trees do not add anything to the game other than percentage improvements to certain stats. In my opinion this is dreadful design and simplifies combat with magic to the point of boredom. Other than that, the skyrim community has created a huge ammount of mods that enhance the game to all new levels and, in my opinion Skyrim is at its best when played with mods.

### Dark Souls 3
